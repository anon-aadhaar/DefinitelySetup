    <p align="center">A folder where projects wanting to do a trusted setup phase2 ceremony can add their artifacts.</p>
</p>

| This folder contains a collection of ceremony artifacts (r1cs, wasm) and setup configuration file which are used to setup a phase2 trusted setup ceremony using [p0tion](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/p0tion/). |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

To request a new ceremony to be setup, you will need to submit a PR with a folder including your ceremony configuration file.

## Guidelines

### Process

- open the PR from a branch named $YOUR_PROJECT_NAME-ceremony
- fill the *p0tionConfig.json* file accordingly:
    + The title of the ceremony will end up being its prefix. Prefixes are simply the title all lowercase, with dashes (*-*) instead of whitespace. For example, given a title of *Example Ceremony*, the prefix will be *example-ceremony*.
    + Fill the rest of the fields with the desired data, ensuring that each circuit details are correct, and that you chose the required Verification method.
    + In the artifacts fields, please add the correct storage path on AWS (the URL to the artifacts) - note that we require both the *r1cs* and the *wasm* files.
    + *Note* that you can use [p0tion phase2cli](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/p0tion) as follows to verify that the config file is correct:
        * `phase2cli validate --template $PATH_TO_THE_TEMPLATE`
- create a directory inside *./ceremonies* and name it with the *prefix* (detailed in the bullet point above). 
- ensure that only one file is added:
    + p0tionConfig.json
- the destination path of the PR should be either of:
    + main (for production runs)
    + staging (for a test run)
    + development (for a test run using experimental features such as VM verification)

### Use setup_ceremony_config.sh to generate the configuration file

If your ceremony includes a large number of circuit instances, you might want to use the bash script included in this folder - **setup_ceremony_config.sh**.

The script will upload your artifacts to a S3 bucket of your choice (must be owned by yourself) and autofill the **p0tionConfig.json** file. You only need to have installed the following:

* **jq** 
* **aws-cli** - please ensure that you set a profile with its credentials (access key id and secret access key). For more info please refer to [aws docs](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

**Usage**:

- `chmod +x setup_ceremony_config.sh`
* `./setup_ceremony_config.sh`

### Template in details

**p0tionConfig.json** template:

```json 
{
  "title": "<CEREMONY_TITLE>",
  "description": "<CEREMONY_DESCRIPTION>",
  "startDate": "<START_DATE FORMAT: 2023-08-07T00:00:00>",
  "endDate": "<END_DATE FORMAT: 2023-09-10T00:00:00>",
  "timeoutMechanismType": "<TIMEOUT_MECHANISM FIXED/DYNAMIC>",
  "penalty": "<THE_PENALTY_APPLIED_TO_USERS (NUMBER)>",
  "circuits": [
      {
          "description": "<CIRCUIT_DESCRIPTION>",
          "compiler": {
              "version": "<COMPILER_VERSION>",
              "commitHash": "<COMPILER_COMMIT_HASH>"
          },
          "template": {
              "source": "<HTTPS_URL_OF_THE_CIRCOM_FILE>",
              "commitHash": "<TEMPLATE_COMMIT_HASH>",
              "paramsConfiguration": ["<CIRCUIT_INSTANCE_PARAMETERS_ARRAY>"]
          },
          "verification": {
              "cfOrVm": "<DESIRED_VERIFICATION_MECHANISM (VM/CF)>"
          },
          "artifacts": {
              "r1csStoragePath": "<URL_TO_THE_CIRCUIT_R1CS>",
              "r1csStoragePath": "<URL_TO_THE_CIRCUIT_WASM>"
          },
          "name": "<CIRCUIT_NAME>",
          "dynamicThreshold": "<THE_DYNAMIC_THRESHOLD (NUMBER)>",
          "fixedTimeWindow": "<THE_FIXED_TIME_WINDOW_FOR_CONTRIBUTION (NUMBER)>",
          "sequencePosition": "<THE_SEQUENCE_POSITION_OF_THE_CIRCUIT_INSTANCE (NUMBER)>"
      }
  ]
}
```

**In-details**:

- title - a string representing the title of your ceremony. Please note that this will form the prefix (more details in the previous section).
- description - a string that can be used to describe a ceremony details
- startDate - the desired start date of your ceremony. Please note that might be changed by the admin.
- endDate - the end date of your ceremony.
- timeoutMechanismType - the type of timeout you would like to use for your ceremony. Options are *FIXED* or *DYNAMIC*. A fixed timeout will always be the same and users who are unable to progress throughout the contribution steps due to either having a slow connection or stopping the ongoing process, will be subject to a timeout of this length. Dynamic on the other hand, will adjust depending on the average time it takes to contribute. 
- penalty - how long will a user need to wait before being able to join the waiting queue again
- circuits - an array of circuit object:
    - description - a string describing the circuit 
    - compiler - an object made of:
        - version - a string with the compiler version. e.g. "1.0"
        - commitHash - a string with the commit id (needs to be a GitHub commit hash)
    - template - an object made of:
        - source - a string with the URL of the circom file
        - commitHash -  a string with the commit id (needs to be a GitHub commit hash)
        - paramsConfiguration - an array of numbers with the parameters of the circuit template
    - verification - an object detailing how the circuit's zKeys will be verified
        - cfOrVm - a string with either "CF" or "VM". If "VM" the following must be added:
            - vmConfigurationType - a string with the VM type - options:
                * "t3.large"
                * "t3.2xlarge"
                * please refer to [AWS docs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for more instance types
            - vmDiskSize - a number with the size of the disk
            - vmDiskType - a string with the type of the disk - options:
                * "gp2"
                * "gp3"
                * "io1"
                * "st1"

    - artifacts - an object with the storage path to the r1cs and wasm on s3
